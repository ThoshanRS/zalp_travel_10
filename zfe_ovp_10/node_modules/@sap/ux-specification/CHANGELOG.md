All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and the changelog is formatted based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## What's new with version 1.84

*Official support of OData V4*

## [1.84.78] - 2023-11-16

### Added

### Changed

### Removed

### Deprecated

### Fixed

- Fixed an exception "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')" when generating the app schemas

- OData V4:
  - If multiple facets refer to target annotations without an ID but with identical labels, only one of the facets was shown in the page editor
  - An error message was added to the logger if the ID was missing for a reference facet. This was wrong, the ID is optional for reference facets. Instead, the error message is now added for missing IDs of collection facets

- @sap-ux/edmx-parser to 0.6.0

## [1.84.67] - 2023-06-14

### Fixed

- OData V4: when adding new pages, the export calculates the route pattern for the new manifest entry.
Indeed, the previous logic did not consider the naming at parent pages, but defined the key name in the pattern as `key`(+ index). This led to navigation errors at run-time. Now, the key names of existing parent pages are taken over to the child page's pattern.

### Added

- OData V4:
  - Generation of `propertyIndex` property in schemas for root properties

- OData V2:
  - Generation of `propertyIndex` property in schemas for root properties

### Quality

- Removed many unnecessary and obsolete resolutions

## [1.84.56] - 2023-01-11

### Added

- General:
  - New definitions for page types are delivered that allow a better distinction:
    - PageTypeV2 for types that occur in OData V2
    - PageTypeV4 for types that occur in OData V4
    - PageType as a superset of all page types that may occur

- OData V4:
  - Default annotationPath is added in schema even if LineItem annotation is not defined

### Changed

- API for OData V2:
  - Inner functions for the generation of app schmas hav ben adapted, i.e. generateAnalyticalListReportSchemaV2, generateListReportSchemaV2, generateObjectPageSchemaV2: the entityTypeName is not passed as an input parameter anymore, as the entity set cannot be uniquely determined from it. Instead, the functions now rely on generateParameters.entitySet, the entityType is derived from this information.  The api version is increased to 7.

### Fixed

- OData V4:
  - Fixed toolbar action IDs by replacing special chars with double colon
  - Not all meta characters of action keys had been converted to `::`, as a consequence existing actions in manifest may have not been considered, or new actions had not been written with the right syntax.
- OData V2:
  - Fixed deletion of fragment cells contents in case last element is deleted

### Quality

- Removed unused and obsolete resolutions

## [1.84.55] - 2022-11-30

### Added

- Missing i18n classification added to labels of custom views

### Changed

- UI adjustments of inplace documentation:
  - moved label of specification and odata version to tree canvas
  - aligned behavior of tree buttons to expand (+) and collapse (-) with given design
  - removed all hard coded colors
  - fixed hover on search results
  - aligned tooltip with given design

- OData V2: fields for `Table > CreateWithParameterDialog` are now shown as enum and the import/export is done implicitly in the background (adding `path` property).

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with adding target namespace information for object page sections

### Quality

## [1.84.54] - 2022-11-17

### Changed

- All parameters in the specification API now are typed.

### Fixed

- OData V2: Adjusted the values shown for `CreateWithParameterDialog` fields > `path` property.
- OData V4: if the key of one view comprised the key of another view, the export of changes generated duplicate view entries in manifest. Activities like reordering of views did not work in this scenario.

### Quality

- Upgrade of "@sap-ux/vocabularies-types", "@sap-ux/annotation-converter", "@sap-ux/edmx-parser"
- Upgrade node version to 16.18.0

## [1.84.53] - 2022-11-03

### Changed

- General: the schema tag `key` (concatenated string) got replaced by the schema tag `keys` that is defined as an array of objects with `name`and `value`.  Reasons are the support of different CSS styles for `name` and `value` as well as globalization (bi-directional languages).

### Quality

- Removed `fe-fpm-writer` from devDependencies

## [1.84.52] - 2022-10-20

### Added

- Applications that show content from schemas may want to also display the technical key - this simplifies identification of the corresponding element in the original source file. To this aim, the tag `key` is used for properties. `key` is a concatenated string that also sows a prefix following one of the patterns:
  - Value for DataFields
  - Key for custom columns etc. where it is a key in the manifest. Only exception are views: they have no prefix as there is logic that programs against the key.
  - ID for facets
  - Action for any action
  - Instance-based navigation: Property + SemanticObject + Action
  - Target for DataFieldForAnnotation.  
In case of Target, an additional schema tag `target` is added: it not only represents the namespace but potentially also the target within the namespace (entity container, entity type, ...)
  
### Changed

- Common dependencies have been moved to the root level.
- Further type definitions have been moved from the specification package to the types package.

## [1.84.51] - 2022-10-06

### Fixed

- At Object Page sections, a missing consideration of potential qualifiers of UI.Identification led to an exception.
- The API can be called with an empty array of annotations. By now this led to an exception, as it was not considered that the annotation vocabularies tools (AVT) return an empty instance.

### Quality

- Upgrade of d3 and d3-color

## [1.84.50] - 2022-09-24

### Quality

- Changed settings to enable the SAP internal delivery of the types package

## [1.84.49] - 2022-09-22

### Added

- OData V4:
  - Zero state support

### Fixed

- OData V4:
  - Reordering of custom views for list report did not work. This was fixed, but consequently the logic for deleting custom views also had to be adapted.
  - When adding new sub-pages to the app.json the export to manifest created wrong keys for the new navigation routes, and wrong query patterns for the targets.

### Quality

- Upgrade version of `typescript`, `ts-jest`, `jest`
- Minify sources
- Enhance test by removing dependency to typescript api
- Test coverage increased

## [1.84.48] - 2022-09-21

### Quality

- Changed settings to enable the SAP internal delivery of the types package

## [1.84.47] - 2022-09-08

### Changed

- For an easier consumption and size reduction, the types definitions now have been moved to a separate types package in the given mono repository. The definitions are still exposed along with the specification package, you can import them from "@sap/ux-specification/dist/src".

- Only one common Manifest definition is exposed from the new types package, the virtual distinction between an OData V2 and an OData V4 version is resolved.

### Removed

- OData V4:
  - Removed `End` value from Placement property for custom extensions

## [1.84.46] - 2022-08-24

### Changed

- The specification module is now build with esbuild instead of webpack.
The new build generates all type information into a types folder, which makes it easier to consume (but the consumption must be adapted). Examples:

````
import { PageType } from '@sap/ux-specification/dist/src/specification/common/'; 
==>  import { PageType } from '@sap/ux-specification/types';

import type { TableCustomColumns, TableCustomColumn } from '@sap/ux-specification/dist/src/v2';
==> import type { TableCustomColumns, TableCustomColumn } from '@sap/ux-specification/types/v2';

import { SectionPosition as SectionPositionV4 } from '@sap/ux-specification/dist/src/v4';
==> import { SectionPosition as SectionPositionV4 } from '@sap/ux-specification/types/v4';
````

- OData V4:
  - LR: Mark view properties `key`, `index` as hidden in schema

### Fixed

- OData V2:
  - OP: Fixed incorrect generation of flexChanges in case of Form, Form Fields and Form Fields referenced from a navigation entity

- OData V4:
  - In some cases sections defined with PresentationVariants did not appear on the object page
  - The resolution of alias definitions using the @SAP__ prefix was not correct, leading also to gaps in the elements that were considered
  - LR: Schema now considers default visualation `UI.LineItem` if not defined in `SelectionPresentationVariant`

## [1.84.45] - 2022-08-11

### Added

- OData V4:
  - the schemas and configs of list report views now also show the visibility property and custom views
  - extend pagemap support for freestyle apps using FPM library

### Changed

- OData V4: With API version 4 of specification - introduced with the given version - the way how routes are represented in the app.json changes: before the pattern was
  `route: key`, now it follows the manifest syntax  

  ```
  key: {
      route: route
  }
  ```

  The switch to an object representation allows to also include other target information like "outbound".
- OData V4: as long as no views are defined in manifest, the showCounts property is not part of the schema, except if it is already maintained.
- OData V2:
  - Mark custom column 'columnIndex' property as hidden

### Fixed

- OData V4:
  - LR: The export of property changes at the page editor led to a deletion of (custom) views in manifest; besides, outbound navigation entries could get deleted.

## [1.84.44] - 2022-07-28

### Quality

- Upgrade of webpack and dependent modules
- Upgrade of terser
- Upgrade of glob-parent
- Upgrade of lerna

## [1.84.43] - 2022-07-14

### Changed

- OData V4: In case of PresentationVariant definitions for charts or line items, an intermediate node had originally been introduced in the Object Page schema that represents the PresentationVariant. This multi-level propagation of references caused issues in the consuming UI, thus the intermediate node got deleted again. The PresentationVariant must be determined by the consuming application if necessary.

### Fixed

- OData V4:
  - Properties of custom columns on object page had not been exported correctly if the table is associated to another entity type via navigation path or is using a PresentationVariant.
  The value help of the anchor in LSP (config JSON) also did not show the right values.
  - Object Page: Fixed an issue with the schema that `annotationPath` for Object Page Table Sections did not contain `qualifier`;
  wrong `annotationPath` and `isViewNode` settings are adjusted.
  - Fixed an issue with export that multiple changes to view's `key` property created duplicated entries in manifest.json

### Quality

- Switch from nexus repository to artifactory

## [1.84.42] - 2022-06-29

### Fixed

- OData V2:
  - OVP: LSP for `model` property of a card now lists models from sap.ui5 section of manifest.json
  - Table type property is now set to blank in case not maintained in manifest.json
  - If two sections of object page referred to an element (e.g. action, table column) of the same name, they had been sync'd by the program logic: changes of one property had also been refelected in the other.
  - One UI adaptation or flexibility change may have been shown multiple times in the config, at different sections.
  - No sorting by time took place before for flexibility changes, as a result an older change of the same property may have shown up instead of the newer one.
  - If several flexibility changes existed for the same control property, secondary ones had not been imported correctly: you could find them under a wrong property name in the config JSON file.

## [1.84.41] - 2022-06-16

### Added

- Missing exposure of type definitions was added.

### Changed

OData V2:

- Custom column property "columnIndex". Schema enhancement by defining range using "minimum=0".

### Removed

OData V4:

- In case of List Report views, non-applicable table properties are removed.

### Fixed

OData V2:

- Custom column issue with Grid/Tree/Analytical table types - empty second custom column is added in xml files

## [1.84.40] - 2022-06-02

### Added

OData V4:

- In case of a default (without qualifier) Selection-/PresentationVariant, the table settings and columns are now considered on list report page.

### Changed

OData V4:

- Titles of charts in sections and header sections now correspond to the run-time.
- Add "annotationPath" schema property to schema for "Table" definition in simple list report.

### Quality

Upgrade node & node-version to 14.x

## [1.84.39] - 2022-05-19

### Changed

- OData V4:
  - For list report views, the content of title and description in the schema got exchanged.
  - LR: If views are enabled, generic table columns won't be used/filled.

### Fixed

- OData V4:
  - If the table setting creationMode existed in the outdated string format, the export just had overwritten the string. Now, an implicit conversion to the new object format takes place.
  - No import of property annotationPath was happening at chart views of List Report.
  - In the app specific schema, the description was missing for charts in sections.
  - Tag 'hidden' was added to the property annotationPath of the ALP chart view in app schema.
  - If defaultTemplateAnnotationPath is maintained and refers to an annotation other than UI.LineItem, the table settings and columns of the referred definition are now imported correctly.

### Quality

- Code smells fixed, as reported by sonarQube.
- Upgrade of annotation vocabularies tools.

## [1.84.38] - 2022-05-05

### Added

OData V4:

- The title of ALP or List Report views is now following the same criteria than the UI5 run-time.

### Fixed

- OData V4:  
  - Problems with deletion of ListReport table views.
  - Unknown properties removed from custom section definition in 'manifest.json'.
  - Export. Delete of entries from `table/views` - views were not deleted during export if entries in annotation file were deleted as first.
  - When changing the table type or other table settings for schema type List Report, the respective manifest setting was not updated if the page was configured with primary and secondary views (i.e. the ALP flavour).

- OData V2:
  - Sections and subsections with a reference to Communication.Contact or Communication.Address had not been shown, support of flexibility changes for them.
  - Facet or section references with multi-level navigation had not been handled correctly.

## [1.84.37] - 2022-04-21

### Added

- Documentation actualised with regards to the new release version 1.100.

- OData V2:
  - LR: Old settings for table type (tableType) had been ignored in newer specification releases. As a consequence, you may have found the table type twice in manifest, once with the old syntax and an additional entry with the new syntax, after switching to a newer UI5 version.
  Now an implicit conversion to the new tableSettings takes place, and the old setting gets automatically replaced during the export.
- OData V4:
  - OP: Added support for presentation variants with chart or table visualization

### Fixed

- OData V4:
  - Exception in case of multi-tab views in manifest that referred to a SelectionVariant.
  - Export of table settings of list report was targeting the wrong manifest settings if a defaultTemplateAnnotationPath is defined, pointing to a SelectionPresentationVariant.
  - List report with multiple views: insert and reordering was not supported correctly.
- OData V2:
  - After an entry of quickVariantSelectionX got deleted, the entry still was present in manifest.json.  
  - Sections of subordinate object pages had not been added correctly to the app schema in all cases.

### Quality

- upgrade ejs to 3.1.7
- SonarQube: issued solved with regards to cognitive complexity

## [1.84.36] - 2022-04-07

### Added

- OData V4: Support of defaultTemplateAnnotationPath as property; consider defaultTemplateAnnotationPath when retrieving the relevant table settings and while switching to ALP flavour.

### Fixed

- OData V2:
  - Extensions - empty "extensions" object was created in "sap.ui5/"extends"/"extensions"/"sap.ui.viewExtensions"/"sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ListReport.view.ListReport"
- Upgrade of async  

### Quality

- Replace type object for schemas by Definition from 'typescript-json-schema'
- upgrade of async

## [1.84.35] - 2022-03-31

### Quality

- use `minimist` resolution

- New structure elements at the Filterbar that represent the selection fields resulting from  the UI.SelectionFields annotation.

### Changed

- In the annotationPath information of the generated JSON schemas all alias definitions are now replaced by the full vocabulary name.
- Descriptions in the schema now follow the following paradigm:
  - For facets we need use title and description, the export logic takes the title and extracts the facet key from it for concatenating the stable ID. The text that shall be shown in the Page Editor shall be the description.  
  - Thus we now generalise: all view nodes (isViewNode = true) have a description (but do not necessarily need a title).  
  - Properties (no isViewNode tag) are not listed in the outline, but in the properties panel. Here, the title shall be used as a label, and the description shall be shown on hover (old UI) or rendered directly (new UI).

### Changed

- The enum for fragment names of column extension is more restrictive now, it does not comprise cells anymore.

- Fix for launch config Import project which can be used to debug the import of a project.
- During the export, fragments are not deleted anymore, as they may comprise customer coding.
- If a fragment is not present yet, it gets created now, i.e. added with an <root> prefix to the list of fragments.
- yarn watch allows debugging of custom extensions now, as the templates are available again in the dist folder.
- Correct sync logic to make sure that config changes are written only to desired places in manifest.json.

### Fixed

- Path references of labels had not been resolved correctly. Common.label annotations of the target reference are now considered correctly.
- The regex pattern for binding changes was incomplete, resulting in validation errors.
